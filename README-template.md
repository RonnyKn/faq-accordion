## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsiveness media queries
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite.js](https://nextjs.dev/) - React framework

### What I learned

I learned React js using Vitejs for the first time. I was Using CRA before and this time CRA is not recommended using.

### Continued development

This Faq-Accordion concept would give me ideas for next project for making an ecommerce website using vite.

### Useful resources

- [Stackoverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This helped me for resolving some bugs.
